                    <p>
                        Happy Slurpy Day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s July 11 aka 7-11 aka free slurpies. This is most certainly going to be a filtered recollection of the day, past days, or what have you, because I know beforehand I’ll be posting this on my site for the 3rd day of my 100 day challenge. So bear with the awkward erm... words as I search for appropriate ways to let manifest what I’ve been feeling, thinking, living?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s a Wednesday. So hump day... I can hear my internal voice withering and cringing at all these half-assed attempts to try to sound appropriate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I suppose as the veil continues to fall or exposure becomes more consistent and natural, all of this, this whole internal voice, the overwhelming consciousness and hesitation, will all slowly resolve into some new formation of a voice. An online voice perhaps?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Who knows, but write I shall in spite of all the preconceived judgment I’m anticipating whether wholly from myself, or the rogue internet visitors what have you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So welcome, welcome, come one come all and listen to the journey that I may profess.
                    <p>
                        Ok words. Too many lame words that may or may not be naturally used. Is it a facade, or is it this internal voice I keep claiming to be building.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bear with me as I bounce around between trivial and... less trivial thoughts and tones, and just... weird expressions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No longer can I proofread every single line, grammatically correct every sentence, and find an optimal aestheticism between each and every paragraph, word, and concept even. I’m trying... to spill out my thoughts as they may come, freely, while also being wary of the lack of privacy this document shall hold.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fear not friend, for eventually we’ll get there. You need not continue to read my ramblings should interest not arise, but eventually my daily outings, thoughts, casual emotions and feelings will spill out onto this parchment.... Digital parchment that is. We’re building. We’ll get there, as time shall uncontrollably pass, comfort shall... settle in?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So on another note, and completely different tone, perspective, personality. Kaizen. It’s a Japanese word that at least from what I’ve read in articles, is best analogous to the idea 10,000 hours for mastery. Essentially any task, skill, goal, dream can be accomplished when broken down into smaller, achievable, consistent goals. The whole premise of this 100 day code challenge is to stay accountable, while building and promoting habits to learn and get used to coding each and every day, whether it be for a mere 30 minutes to an hour at a time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where motivation may fail or run thin, discipline will continue to carry you. While you may not be looking forward to setting forth with the small menial task for the day, if you have the discipline to do it anyway, the habit that.. transgresses (?) will be worth your while.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So thats words... that describe in one way or another why I’m doing this. And I’ve always loved to write. It’s been my only creative expression. And now I’m helping create an outlet for that creativity, while building meaningful skills to advance in other aspects of life!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So learn with me code with me read with me write with me. I’ll be here. :)

                    <h3>Sometimes (DIARY)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes the world seems so much heavier than it really is. And sometimes, there are what seem initially, life changing realizations, that either later play out to be false hope, temporary reliefs, or potential opportunities that maybe have just lacked the required effort and attention. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a world of perspective and supposed infinite possibilities, the possibilities themselves incite inaction. Impulsive and yet frozen in indecision, everything continues to fly by. Sometimes... well sometimes things fall into place and other times not. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But fascination and curiosity as it may seem, makes everything manageable... sometimes. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And other times the rain falls harder than anticipated or that one strike of lightning hits closer to home than comfort would have it,
                        But as luck might have it, even though desire would not, the world continues to spin majestically, too proud to admit, and too loyal to do otherwise. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And although what may seemingly only be strings of cliches tied nonsensically together, the harmonious tandem of each makes sense. 
                        Sometimes...
                    </p>

                    <h3>Distractions (DIARY)</h3>
                    <p>Distractions play their role well. I suppose that goes without saying. But on further examination, what manifests deeper inside, begs curiosity. 

                    A lot of the ‘swirling chaos’ has faded, or subsided, at least to some degree. While on another, it seems to have only lessened in magnitude, interwoven between distractions that dance in the air. Oblivious to sensation, but obvious to the curious mind. The frequency, the resonation are all very much the same, but the storm itself somehow feels hidden. The intensity holds steadfast, but there is no trace in its passing. 

                    Far fewer pieces fly about destructively, less thoughts turmoil and cloud reality. And yet a very distinct haze still remains. Uncertainty still rings loudly, layered atop the fragile silence. 

                    The piercing void echoes into the past. </p>


                    <p> I stand knee deep in this swampy morass, covered in a dense, disillusioning fog. And yet in the distance, I can see, or perhaps imagine, mountaintops, and ravines. 

                    The air is cold but there is no breeze. However warmth is more than fathomable. It is beyond a construct of imagination, yet its existence is still questionable. 

                    I close my eyes and try to ‘feel’ outward. To document with my mind and senses the reality that I’m currently experiencing and facing. But all I hear is silence. All I feel is nothing. 

                    I close my eyes harder, focus more intently, open my soul more honestly. </p>


                    <p>I might’ve imagined that a breeze washed across my face. Some cold gentle hand that for a moment felt soothing.</p>

                    <p>My eyes snapped open and the sorrowful swamp was but a knee high meadow. The fog but a light dusky haze, the sun barely breaking the horizon. And yet... the same empty feeling remained. This hidden void lingered. </p> 


                    <p>I sighed and trekked forward through the swampy meadow of shackles towards the mountains. </p>
