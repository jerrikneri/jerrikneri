    <h3>“Never compare yourself and your progress to anyone but yourself.”</h3> 
    <p>
    I’m proud to say that I’m learning to read a lot. I always liked to write creatively, but never found a passion or appreciation for reading. In fact, I always dreaded it. But through sheer discipline, some motivation, and a growing hunger to learn, I’ve found the beauty in setting time to read every day.
    </p><p>
    So from time to time, I might just try to reflect on the articles or book that I’ve read for the day and regurgitate it here to see if I really understand it. Or, to see what I really took from it and possibly how I can apply it or agree/disagree with it.
    </p><p>
    Here’s a quote from an article I read today:
    </p><p>
    “Never compare yourself and your progress to anyone but yourself.”
    </p><p>
    Like most advise and quotes, that’s much easier said than done. Comparison, I think is something that plagues everyone. It’s almost too natural not to do. As if envy is just seething in our veins, waiting to surface if we allow it or pay it too much attention.
    </p><p>
    I think it’s good to know where you stand in comparison to others. To be mindful in that sense. To not be overly oblivious to what’s happening around you, or what other people in your field or industry or circle of friends are doing. It’s good to have perspective and perhaps some sort of measurable metric? But once those metrics start to generate negative thoughts or make you feel less of a person and accomplished for what you’ve personally done, then it becomes detrimental. Suddenly your acknowledge of such is hindering. 
    </p><p>
    It’s far too easy to focus on what you don’t have, haven’t accomplished, or aren’t yet. I also think it’s easy to forget that we’re all unique individuals with our own unique paths. For each person, things happen at different times, in different ways, in different mediums. As much as our society tries to cling onto some sort of structure - which has to be necessary to some degree, for some shape and organization, right? - people inevitably will mold their own paths, and figure things out at their own pace. Being “asian” and not having finished college is more than shameful. It burdens me to this day to have to think about it, and continue to accept that. 
    </p><p>
    But why?
    </p><p>
    Culture? Tradition? Social precedence? I’m not less of a person because of that, and yet somewhere ingrained in my head, I’ve developed, acquired, the mindset that I am. That thought process can be and is paralyzing. It’s demoralizing. I can’t help but internally hang my head low when the discussion of college comes up. Or subconsciously try to over compensate with varying skill sets for the paper degree I haven’t accomplished.
    </p><p>
    It feels like trying to walk a straight line blindfolded versus trying to balance on a narrow plank suspended in the air. You can walk confidently in any which direction and not really know where you’re going. Or you can freeze in indecision and demoralization as you absorb how narrow you perceive your path to be and the height at which you’re trying to scale this path at - the more you look around and take in what’s around you, the less you feel like moving, the less you realize how far you’ve come, and the plank beneath you seems to shrink and narrow and your path to be journeyed, fade farther into the distance. 
    </p><p>
    Learning therefore to believe in yourself. Be mindful enough of who and what’s around you so that you’re not blindfolded, but focused enough that you realize the plank is on the ground, and all you have to do is believe in yourself and continue to inch forward.
    </p><p>
    That’s a lot of weird drawn out analogies for such a simple quote. It’s more than relevant for me in my life as I constantly remind myself to count my blessings and regale in my accomplishments. Dividing each task that needs to be done into millimeters of my plank walk.
    </p><p>
    I’m going to keep reading and believing in myself, and have faith that it will work itself out.

    <h3>Life is short.</h3> 
    <p>
    My heart dropped and the room froze to a still silence. Suddenly I was the only one standing in the room. The person before me held a powerful gravity. Silence rung. Time seemed to slow down. My breaths ran short. My heart sunk deeper and deeper. I felt either reality slipping away or crashing abruptly like a consuming wave. 
    </p><p>
    I couldn’t help but stare at his face - I was compelled to do so, locked in on the moment. I was trying to make sense of the situation. Reason something into why and what lay before me. I waited patiently and watched closely for movement. 
    </p><p>
    Nothing. Silence. 
    </p><p>
    Meanwhile, the room seemed to get heavier. The ceiling sinking closer to my face. The walls caving in to create a narrow passage.
    </p><p>
    I heard my breath echo. I felt my chest rise and fall. I waited for him to do the same.
    </p><p>
    Still nothing.
    </p><p>
    I felt empty. More empty than the body that lay before me. Reason and Logic shied away from the moment, failing to attribute any answers.
    </p><p>
    I was locked in some strange illusory trance. I couldn’t look away. His presence was pulling me closer, striking the chords of my curiosity, while baffling my mind and reason in the same instant.
    </p><p>
    Everything seemed to shrink and implode upon itself. I felt frozen, while the very environment around me seemed to collapse.
    </p><p>
    Then someone broke my gaze, and I gasped for breath. The aura of isolation surrounding me vanished. The phenomenon that was occurring right before me didn’t make any more sense. But that’s OK.
    </p><p>
    Life is short. Terminal. Full circle. Untimely.
    </p><p>
    “Ride safe bro.”

    <h3>“Nothing changes if nothing changes.”</h3> 
    <p>
    There’s so many ways to dissect that quote. It’s applicable in a lot of different ways. I’m conflicted with how to interpret it, let alone apply it. I suppose depending on your views of destiny, how things play out, and just life in general it can be positive?
    </p><p>
    I’m a strong believer in holding true to who you are as a person. That alone has its troubles, as it becomes increasingly easy to make excuses for the type of person you are, and fall into some perpetual motion, or chain of blanket excuses to stay in your comfortable shell. On the other hand, I’m also a strong proponent that growth happens when you’re uncomfortable - at your edges and limits. Perhaps I’m picking and choosing the bits and pieces that give me positive affirmation, while ignoring the parts that disagree with my values, I can readily admit that that is a possibility. I don’t think anything falls into your lap, at least not anymore. I was naive and entitled enough at least at one point in my life to think that I deserved more without working harder for it. Caught in some incessant battle of comparisons with others, with blame placed only outwardly. I think working towards something continually, each day, eventually snowballing into visceral and measurable change can at one point seem like things fall into your lap.
    </p><p>
    “What got you here, won’t get you there.”
    </p><p>
    On the surface, it makes sense. But at what cost I suppose? Is it worth becoming someone who you’re not, to get what you wanted? Wherein between does passion wane, and your greed or pleasure or appreciation for things meet or clash? If destiny plays it’s part - depending on your own personal interpretation of that phenomenon - you could argue that the choices you make in between may not matter as much. But that’s not to say they don’t matter at all as they have a direct impact on the journey and quality of life, happiness, success - however you’d like to measure and gauge, label even, your metric of a good life.
    </p><p>
    I can personally say that I’ve held onto the crutch of being shy. That in one way or another, I tend to entrap myself in that bubble, limit myself even, because I see it as an attribute of what makes me, me. I’m mindful enough to realize that much, but naive enough to have not taken enough dutiful action on it thus far? 
    </p><p>
    On some deep internal reflection, I could look at this whole train of thought, even documenting these opinions as some self attempt to justify who I am and what I believe. Therein lies the ideas that sometimes thinking wholly just incites inaction or indecision. After angling a thought or perspective, you just come full circle. Geometrically, that makes sense right? If you ‘curve’ your box enough and attack your own thought process with enough angles... we’re drawing some analogous circle now.
    </p><p>
    I think change, or growth, or teeming on the limits of your boundaries, can be measured in different ways, more specifically, smaller units of... change? That’s a lot of confusing words in a round about manner to attempt to say that, I think a lot of the focus on changing and growing is too macro. You don’t become a new person over night. 
    </p><p>
    Kaizen.
    </p><p>
    There’s that word again. Google says:
    </p><p>
    “Kaizen, also known as continuous improvement, is a long-term approach to work that systematically seeks to achieve small, incremental changes in processes in order to improve efficiency and quality.”
    </p><p>
    So nothing changes if nothing changes, but if you’re making small micro changes each day, they’re not necessarily observable? I think these are all different angles of saying the same thing and these quotes are meant to be vague and interpreted, and maybe even incite a little bit of controversy.
    </p><p>
    I’m proud of who I am and the small steps I’m taking each day to work towards becoming a better person. I think that’s enough.

        <h3>When Langauge Fails</h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes, language fails you. Whether it be the unrhythmic chants of a song, the way you drape your body across the room, or even the soft spoken, heart-felt words that you draw out in regular conversation. But there’s a purity in allowing for how language may fail us sometimes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Acknowledging that purity is only half the battle.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a world where we’re all seeking clarity, failing to communicate in the one powerful asset we have over the ordinary animal can be appalling. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Emotions speak volumes, silently and loudly. They carry waves of history, multi-faceted, complex structures of feelings that are too heavy to carry but flow through each and everyone one of us effortlessly. Emotions are felt, heard, seen, spoken; conveyed sometimes through the very senses that we’re trying to suppress. They riddle our thoughts, drive our actions, and stagger even the strongest man in the midst of reaching greatness. They blind the great, empower the hungry, and feed our greed.
        </p>
        <p>
            And yet, in the absence of language and communication, are we just primal? Are we chained by our evolutionary adaptation? 
            Without such, are we stripped of every human aspect that defines us? Or does it entice one to dance along the blurred lines and embrace a new empathic mindfulness?
        </p>
        <p>
            The use of emphatic words drown out, and all we’re left with is indirect empathy. Bewildered, we strike guesses in this overcast fog of uncertainty. Without direction, where will we go?
        </p>
        <p>
            When you have built your life on language, on words, on expressing character through ink and pen... and all that crumbles before you, what then? Can I entice you, bestow upon you even, dancing in between my lines of...language... can I cast the right conversation of eyes and still convey to you with great detail, what I intend?
        </p>
        <p>
            ***
        </p>
        <p> 
            I stood there and held her, because at that exact moment, language had failed me. I scrawled through the vocabulary that I had attained over years, trying to compose a single message but I had nothing. I held her in my arms as she cried and let the moment speak for itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            And it was beautiful in it’s own way.

        <h3>Friday the 13th</h3>
        <p>
            Today is my mom’s 70th birthday. I think her birthday is part of the reason that my favorite number is 13. That... and growing up I just wanted to be different. In elementary school, everyone thought it was bad luck and stayed away from it, so I embraced it. That’s not to say I’ve embraced all the social outliers, but something about that number enticed me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yesterday, I asked her what the biggest piece of advice she had for me after her 70 years of living was.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Take responsibility for everything that you do.”
        </p>
        <p>
            We had a good conversation about it, and she detailed about how it pretty much covered every aspect of your life. From patience, to integrity, to simply realizing that each action and decision you make has a consequence.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m thankful. For my life, my family, and all my blessings.
        </p>

        <h3>15 minute run ons</h3>
        <p>
            Themes and regurgitating information. Internally processing what this will probably be about, is what that line was meant to be...
        </p>
        <p>
            So lately, I think the reoccurring theme in my life, or actually, for the whole year of 2018, has been patience. I think God, life, the upper power - whatever you’d like to call it or label it as, has been recreating that lesson for me daily.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even with daily recognition, it still takes a daily reminder to humble yourself, realize what you can control, and let manifest the work you’ve put in thus far. Perhaps I grew up with an over arching theme or sense of being impulsive - always thinking I was going to be left behind by life, or that if I didn’t make the next life decision soon or quick enough, that it would deter me from better things. Constantly trying to min/max each path in my life and ironically shackling myself with indecision and inaction in the process. The countless options and opportunities when all presented before you create paralysis and are more than staggering.
        </p>
        <p>
            With all that said, patience. Letting things grow. Letting yourself grow. Letting things just simply be, for nothing other than the fact that it’s simply out of your reach or influence.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started this year with a couple of resolutions, some of which I’ve been able to maintain, and others which I’m still trying to redeem myself in. July being about the half-way point through the year, I suppose this writing is a good time to reflect on that.
        </p>
        <p>
            I intended to finish the #100daysofcode challenge, which I started about a month or two ago, and fell off on about 20 or so days in. I’ve now restarted and am on Day 4.
            I made it a goal to read at least one book each month. With the audiobooks and pdfs that I’ve been able to rent with a library card, I’ve probably tripled that. Some might argue that audiobooks aren’t really reading, or you don’t retain the information as well, and I would agree. Which is why I revisited a couple of the audiobooks again to listen for any information I might’ve missed the first time around.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through that course of seeking new information a lot of great things happened. I developed a genuine hunger to read and learn more. I dedicate - on most days - at least an hour to reading something, coding, self-improvement, or even for entertainment. For better or for worse, I read Grain Brain and fell into some anti-carb blackhole and came out the other side a full-fledged Keto participant. The health benefits are amazing so far.
        </p>
        <p>
            And what I’ve taken away from the majority of books that I’ve read, which in many ways aren’t even related is a uniting theme - meditate. Setting the foundation for your mind to snowball positivity. Making your bed the first thing in the morning for that first win. Honing in on the idea that your mind can’t discern thought from reality - so visualizing your dreams and goals as well as the steps you need to take daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly to achieve them, is almost guaranteed to get you there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Along the way, there are distractions. There are always distractions. Video games, social media, and girls namely. But through outright discipline, and the building of genuinely positive and productive habits, shit gets done.
        </p>
        <p>
            I lost my train of thought, following the trail of breadcrumbs from all these tangents. But here I am, writing, professing, reflecting. Attempting to flow an open mind onto digital parchment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Happy Thursday fam. <333

        <h3>Filtered, rampant, 15 minute thoughts.</h3>
        <p>
            Happy Slurpee Day.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s July 11 aka 7-11 aka free slurpies. This is most certainly going to be a filtered recollection of the day, past days, or what have you, because I know beforehand I’ll be posting this on my site for the 3rd day of my 100 day challenge. So bear with the awkward erm... words as I search for appropriate ways to let manifest what I’ve been feeling, thinking, living?
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s a Wednesday. So hump day... I can hear my internal voice withering and cringing at all these half-assed attempts to try to sound appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
            I suppose as the veil continues to fall or exposure becomes more consistent and natural, all of this, this whole internal voice, the overwhelming consciousness and hesitation, will all slowly resolve into some new formation of a voice. An online voice perhaps?
        </p>
        <p>
            Who knows, but write I shall in spite of all the preconceived judgment I’m anticipating whether wholly from myself, or the rogue internet visitors what have you.
        </p>
        <p>
            So welcome, welcome, come one come all and listen to the journey that I may profess.
        <p>
            Ok words. Too many lame words that may or may not be naturally used. Is it a facade, or is it this internal voice I keep claiming to be building.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bear with me as I bounce around between trivial and... less trivial thoughts and tones, and just... weird expressions.
        </p>
        <p>
            No longer can I proofread every single line, grammatically correct every sentence, and find an optimal aestheticism between each and every paragraph, word, and concept even. I’m trying... to spill out my thoughts as they may come, freely, while also being wary of the lack of privacy this document shall hold.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fear not friend, for eventually we’ll get there. You need not continue to read my ramblings should interest not arise, but eventually my daily outings, thoughts, casual emotions and feelings will spill out onto this parchment.... Digital parchment that is. We’re building. We’ll get there, as time shall uncontrollably pass, comfort shall... settle in?
        </p>
        <p>
            So on another note, and completely different tone, perspective, personality. Kaizen. It’s a Japanese word that at least from what I’ve read in articles, is best analogous to the idea 10,000 hours for mastery. Essentially any task, skill, goal, dream can be accomplished when broken down into smaller, achievable, consistent goals. The whole premise of this 100 day code challenge is to stay accountable, while building and promoting habits to learn and get used to coding each and every day, whether it be for a mere 30 minutes to an hour at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where motivation may fail or run thin, discipline will continue to carry you. While you may not be looking forward to setting forth with the small menial task for the day, if you have the discipline to do it anyway, the habit that.. transgresses (?) will be worth your while.
        </p>
        <p>
            So thats words... that describe in one way or another why I’m doing this. And I’ve always loved to write. It’s been my only creative expression. And now I’m helping create an outlet for that creativity, while building meaningful skills to advance in other aspects of life!
        </p>
        <p>
            So learn with me code with me read with me write with me. I’ll be here. :)

        <h3>Sometimes</h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes the world seems so much heavier than it really is. And sometimes, there are what seem initially, li changing realizations, that either later play out to be false hope, temporary reliefs, or potential opportunities that maybe have just lacked the required effort and attention. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In a world of perspective and supposed infinite possibilities, the possibilities themselves incite inaction. Impulsive and yet frozen in indecision, everything continues to fly by. Sometimes... well sometimes things fall into place and other times not. 
        </p>
        <p>
            But fascination and curiosity as it may seem, makes everything manageable... sometimes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            And other times the rain falls harder than anticipated or that one strike of lightning hits closer to home than comfort would have it,
            But as luck might have it, even though desire would not, the world continues to spin majestically, too proud to admit, and too loyal to do otherwise. 
        </p>
        <p>
            And although what may seemingly only be strings of cliches tied nonsensically together, the harmonious tandem of each makes sense. 
            Sometimes...

        <h3>Distractions</h3>
        <p>Distractions play their role well. I suppose that goes without saying. But on further examination, what manifests deeper inside, begs curiosity. 

        A lot of the ‘swirling chaos’ has faded, or subsided, at least to some degree. While on another, it seems to have only lessened in magnitude, interwoven between distractions that dance in the air. Oblivious to sensation, but obvious to the curious mind. The frequency, the resonation are all very much the same, but the storm itself somehow feels hidden. The intensity holds steadfast, but there is no trace in its passing. 

        Far fewer pieces fly about destructively, less thoughts turmoil and cloud reality. And yet a very distinct haze still remains. Uncertainty still rings loudly, layered atop the fragile silence. 

        The piercing void echoes into the past. </p>


        <p> I stand knee deep in this swampy morass, covered in a dense, disillusioning fog. And yet in the distance, I can see, or perhaps imagine, mountaintops, and ravines. 

        The air is cold but there is no breeze. However warmth is more than fathomable. It is beyond a construct of imagination, yet its existence is still questionable. 

        I close my eyes and try to ‘feel’ outward. To document with my mind and senses the reality that I’m currently experiencing and facing. But all I hear is silence. All I feel is nothing. 

        I close my eyes harder, focus more intently, open my soul more honestly. </p>


        <p>I might’ve imagined that a breeze washed across my face. Some cold gentle hand that for a moment felt soothing.</p>

        <p>My eyes snapped open and the sorrowful swamp was but a knee high meadow. The fog but a light dusky haze, the sun barely breaking the horizon. And yet... the same empty feeling remained. This hidden void lingered. </p> 


        <p>I sighed and trekked forward through the swampy meadow of shackles towards the mountains. </p>
