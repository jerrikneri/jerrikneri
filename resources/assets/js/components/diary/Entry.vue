        <h3>When Langauge Fails</h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes, language fails you. Whether it be the unrhythmic chants of a song, the way you drape your body across the room, or even the soft spoken, heart-felt words that you draw out in regular conversation. But there’s a purity in allowing for how language may fail us sometimes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Acknowledging that purity is only half the battle.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a world where we’re all seeking clarity, failing to communicate in the one powerful asset we have over the ordinary animal can be appalling. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Emotions speak volumes, silently and loudly. They carry waves of history, multi-faceted, complex structures of feelings that are too heavy to carry but flow through each and everyone one of us effortlessly. Emotions are felt, heard, seen, spoken; conveyed sometimes through the very senses that we’re trying to suppress. They riddle our thoughts, drive our actions, and stagger even the strongest man in the midst of reaching greatness. They blind the great, empower the hungry, and feed our greed.
        </p>
        <p>
            And yet, in the absence of language and communication, are we just primal? Are we chained by our evolutionary adaptation? 
            Without such, are we stripped of every human aspect that defines us? Or does it entice one to dance along the blurred lines and embrace a new empathic mindfulness?
        </p>
        <p>
            The use of emphatic words drown out, and all we’re left with is indirect empathy. Bewildered, we strike guesses in this overcast fog of uncertainty. Without direction, where will we go?
        </p>
        <p>
            When you have built your life on language, on words, on expressing character through ink and pen... and all that crumbles before you, what then? Can I entice you, bestow upon you even, dancing in between my lines of...language... can I cast the right conversation of eyes and still convey to you with great detail, what I intend?
        </p>

            I stood there and held her, because at that exact moment, language had failed me. I scrawled through the vocabulary that I had attained over years, trying to compose a single message but I had nothing. I held her in my arms as she cried and let the moment speak for itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            And it was beautiful in it’s own way.
